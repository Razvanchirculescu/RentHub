# RentHub

RentHub is a website that allows people to rent out properties such as apartments, houses or vacation homes, to travelers seeking temporary accommodation, for either leisure or business. These properties are listed along with information about their location, facilities, availability, pricing and a map representation. The application has a landing page which displays all available properties, a property page with info regarding its location, pictures and a booking calendar, a login page and a registration page, and a user page on which the user can edit his/her details and see past or upcoming bookings.

The application also has a dark mode to enhance eye comfort to those who prefer black themes.
